- Just after switching to GPS Mouse mode, you'll get two lines before the real GPS data :
	$PSRFTXT,Version: GSW3.2.2_3.1.00.12-SDK003P1.01a ..
	$PSRFTXT,Version2:F-GPS-03-0702021..
- Another info I that I tracked down the command sent when in GPS mouse mode to activate and deactivate WAAS :
	Set WAAS
	$PSRF151,01*0F..   
	UnSet WAAS
	$PSRF151,00*0E..
