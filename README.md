# DGManager
DGManager.NET is a management utility for the GlobalSat DG-100 GPS datalogger. It provides additional 
features such as allowing you to geocode / geotag photos. Requires the .NET Framework 2.0. NEW: It can 
now be used with any GPX file!  Migrated from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dgmanager-net/

This program can also handle working with a number of different file formats of spatial data: CSV, GPX, GlobalSat Data File (*.GSD), Google Earth (*.kml), NMEA, OpenStreetMap (*.osm), MapExpert 2.0 (*.ovl), OziExplorer Tracks (*.plt), Polish Map Format (*.mp).  Most formats can also be written to.  It is also possible to create plugins with converters by putting a DLL in the same folder with a class that implements IPointReader and/or IPointWriter in the DGManager.Backend library.

This project was originally created by Reuben Bluff and hosted on SourceForge here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dgmanager-net/  
I hope by posting it here the code will be more accessible to make modifications and improvements.
