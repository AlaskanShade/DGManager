# DGManager
DGManager.NET is a management utility for the GlobalSat DG-100 GPS datalogger. It provides additional 
features such as allowing you to geocode / geotag photos. Requires the .NET Framework 2.0. NEW: It can 
now be used with any GPX file!  Migrated from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dgmanager-net/

I hope by posting it here the code will be more accessible to make modifications and improvements.
