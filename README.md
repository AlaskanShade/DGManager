# DGManager
DGManager.NET is a management utility for the GlobalSat DG-100 GPS datalogger. It provides additional 
features such as allowing you to geocode / geotag photos. Requires the .NET Framework 4.5. NEW: It can 
now be used with any GPX file!  Migrated from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dgmanager-net/

This program can also handle working with a number of different file formats of spatial data.  Most formats can also be written to.  It is also possible to create plugins with converters by putting a DLL in the same folder with a class that implements IPointReader and/or IPointWriter in the DGManager.Backend library.

I hope by posting it here the code will be more accessible to make modifications and improvements.
